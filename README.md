# Wargames

Wargames is an awesome service setup by the awesome folks at [OverTheWire](http://www.overthewire.org).

It tests one's ability to exercise certain security concepts in the form of games.

The best part is that it's FREE and can be started from a complete beginner!!

## Modules
There are a few different "games" within the WarGames. Each is essentially getting more advanced on it's way:

Let's just get started with Bandit

## Bandit

The Bandit module consists of levels 0 - 34.

### Level 0
#### Game Instructions
>The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

This level is the most basic of levels. It simply needs you to `ssh` into the game.
You'll need the login credentials (obviously):
```bash
username: bandit0
password: bandit0
```
All we have to do here is `ssh` into the WarGames.
We do this by using the `ssh` command with the `-p` flag on the port `2220` and the `bandit0` username:
```bash
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```
Then just use the password `bandit0` when prompted.

That's it! You're on your way to being a hacker!

### Level 0 -> 1
#### Game Instructions
>The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Super simple setup here. Just `cat` the `readme` file:
```bash
cat readme

```
Bam! Password revealed. Now let's use the password for the next level.

### Level 1 -> 2
#### Game Instructions
>The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

This level is also quite simple. The password for the next level is stored in a file named `-`. So all we have to do is `ssh` using the next level `bandit1` username and  use `cat` to read the file... right?
```bash
cat -
...
```
Nope!!! They pulled a sneaky on you. Notice that when you try this, the __command line will stall__.  

In bash, the `-` will tell the interpreter to look for a `flag`. So what we need to do here is tell the command line that `-` is a **file**. How do we do this? With `./`

State that __this current directory, look for file__:
```bash
cat ./-

```
Boom! now you have the password and you've hacked the mainframe. Now let's go to the next level.

### Level 2 -> 3
#### Game Instructions
>The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory
